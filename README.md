# Shootout Remastered: All out War
Advanced FPS inside of roblox.
After almost three years, I finally learned to make FPS games inside of roblox.
It will be my first ever FPS game launch and its gonna be a system made by me.

### 1. Idea
- A game inspired by Insurgency: Sandstorm and ArmA 3
- Reloading always dumps your mag
- Limited mags
- Minimal ui for immersion
- Two teams
- Different gamemodes
- No health ui
- Stamina

### 2. Workflow
- Framework
- Gameplay
- Gunplay
- Customization

### 3. Progress
- [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/mRVDuOby/advanced-fps)

### 4. To Do
